# IOT-ENABLED-MEDICAL-IMAGE-PROCESSOR-USING-FPGA
In This Project The Image processing using Rapberry Pi and fpga interfacing is discussed. In which saveral medical image processing filter are designed using verilog code. The main objective was to design a system of low cost , powerfull and userfriendly way of 24 hours real time medical image processing using internet of things.
