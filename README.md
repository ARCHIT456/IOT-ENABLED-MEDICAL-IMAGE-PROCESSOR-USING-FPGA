# IOT-ENABLED-MEDICAL-IMAGE-PROCESSOR-USING-FPGA
The image processing based on interfacing of FPGA and Raspberry Pi using Internet of Things that is recently introduced technique is a hot topic in present scenario. The unimaginable interconnection of smart devices, smart cities, smart vehicles, and smart people throughout the globe is made possible by Internet of things. The hardware implementation of various filters used in medical image processing using Internet of things on an FPGA platform is presented in this dissertation. The Raspberry Pi and FPGA interfacing based implementation of image processing filters using Internet of Things have gotten huge consideration from the exploration group in the previous couple of years. A powerful, low cost, user friendly way of 24 hours real time medical image processing system based on Internet of things has been offered by this technique.
